Hello guys! This is the task i was delegated. i will post updates and step by step procedure on the analysis to carry everyone along and please feel free to make suggestions. Thank you.

Descriptive & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Assigned to: Team Member - **KHAIRAT TIJANI**
   - Responsibilities:
     - Perform initial analysis to understand distributions, trends, and general statistics (e.g., average gross revenue, distribution across different genres or distributors).
     - Visualize key statistics with plots (e.g., revenue vs. theaters, distribution of release dates).
     - Highlight findings that may be valuable for deeper analysis.

SUMMARY OF DESCRIPTIVE AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
 1. Descriptive Statistics
   - Number of Theaters:
     - Minimum: 7
     - 1st Quartile: 402.2
     - Median: 1,043
     - Mean: 1,673.7
     - 3rd Quartile: 3,185.5
     - Maximum: 4,600
     - Standard Deviation: 1,467.4
     
   - Total Gross ($):
     - Minimum: $181,537
     - 1st Quartile: $9,122,107
     - Median: $22,572,675
     - Mean: $62,996,570
     - 3rd Quartile: $72,588,475
     - Maximum: $718,814,950
     - Standard Deviation: $99,065,048
     
2. Exploratory Visualizations
    Histograms:
   - Theaters: 
     - The histogram shows a right-skewed distribution. The red density curve highlights this skewness, while the green normal curve (based on mean and standard deviation) confirms deviation from normality. 
     - A higher frequency of movies is shown in theaters below 2,000, with relatively fewer movies in 3,000+ theaters.
   - Total Gross:
     - The histogram of total gross exhibits a highly right-skewed distribution. Most movies earned below $100 million, with only a few crossing that threshold. 
     - The density curve (red) indicates a heavy tail, diverging significantly from the green normal curve overlay.

   Boxplots:
   - Theaters:
     - The boxplot shows a relatively uniform spread of values, with no extreme outliers detected. Most movies are in a range of around 400 to 4,600 theaters.
   - Total Gross:
     - The boxplot reveals the presence of extreme outliers, indicating a few movies with exceptionally high earnings.

3. Key Insights:
   - Distributions:
     - Both variables exhibit non-normal distributions, with Total Gross being more heavily skewed than Theaters.
     - The bell-curve overlays emphasize deviations from normality, suggesting that statistical techniques accounting for skewness (e.g., transformations) might be necessary for further analysis.
   - Outliers:
     - Total Gross shows clear outliers in the data, as seen in the boxplot, which should be investigated further for their potential influence on statistical models.
