Statistical Analysis & Correlation Testing
# Step 1: Correlation Coefficient
correlation <- cor(df$Theaters, df$Total Gross, method = "pearson")
print(paste("Correlation Coefficient: ", correlation))

# Step 2: Hypothesis Testing for Correlation
cor.test(df$Theaters, df$Total Gross)

# Step 3: Scatterplot with Regression Line
plot(df$Theaters, df$Total Gross, 
     main = "Scatterplot of Theaters vs. Total Gross", 
     xlab = "Number of Theaters", ylab = "Total Gross ($)", 
     col = "blue", pch = 19)

# Add regression line
abline(lm(df$Total Gross ~ df$Theaters), col = "red", lwd = 2)
