I will be handling data cleaning and preprocessing.

Responsibilities:
- Gather and clean the dataset (if not already clean).
- Remove any duplicates, check for missing values, and standardize formats (e.g., release dates, revenue).
- Collaborate with the data analysis lead to define the variables and metrics needed.


SUMMARY OF DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING
Using rstudio, we cleaned and processed the data using the following processes so we could perform statistical analysis on the data.
1. Data Loading:  
   - We Started by reading the cleaned CSV file containing the top 200 movies in 2023 using the read_csv function and displayed the first few rows using head(df) to inspect the data.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - *Theaters Column*: We cleaned the "Theaters" column by removing commas using gsub(",", "", df$Theaters) and then converted the values to numeric format using as.numeric().
   - *Total Gross Column*: For the "Total Gross" column, we removed both the dollar sign ($) and commas using `gsub("[\\$,]", "", df$Total Gross) and then converted the cleaned values into numeric format.

3. Handling Missing Data:
   - We checked for missing values in both the "Theaters" and "Total Gross" columns using the sum(is.na()) function to count any NA (missing) values.
   - After confirming that there were missing values, we used na.omit(df) to remove any rows containing missing data.

This process ensures that the data is properly formatted and ready for further analysis, such as descriptive statistics and correlationÂ analysis.
