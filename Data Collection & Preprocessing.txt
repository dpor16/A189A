I will be handling data cleaning and preprocessing
Responsibilities:
 - Gather and clean the dataset (if not already clean).
 - Remove any duplicates, check for missing values, and standardize formats (e.g., release dates, revenue).
 - Collaborate with the data analysis lead to define the variables and metrics needed.
